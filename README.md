### Faster Fuzzy Matching/Lookup

This script will read an excel file, and match data between sheets as specified by the user. 

A new sheet will be created with the fuzzy matched values according to user's given parameters.

Matches much faster than the Excel Fuzzy Lookup add-in. Able to handle larger data set matching with broader matching requirements.
